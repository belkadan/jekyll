h1. Jekyll

By Tom Preston-Werner, Nick Quaranto, and many awesome contributors! Forked by Jordy Rose.

Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind "GitHub Pages":http://pages.github.com, which you can use to host your project's page or blog right here from GitHub.

If you've stumbled upon this page from outside, you probably want the "source repository":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll.

h2. This fork

The main purpose of this fork is to add a dependency-based form of incremental generation, to avoid regenerating pages that haven't changed. Other changes, even some rather drastic ones, are realized as plug-ins in the "Shadowbox":http://github.com/belkadan/jekyll-shadowbox theme, which should work with any vanilla Jekyll installation, and with other themes (possibly with some slight modifications).
